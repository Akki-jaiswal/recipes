    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of wide, flat pasta, rich meat sauce (ragù), 
        creamy béchamel sauce, and plenty of cheese, typically mozzarella and Parmesan. It's a hearty, 
        comforting meal perfect for feeding a crowd or enjoying on a cozy evening. The beauty of lasagna 
        lies in the harmonious blend of textures and flavors, from the tender pasta to the savory meat 
        and the gooey, melted cheese.
    </p>
    <p>
        While it might seem daunting, making lasagna from scratch is a rewarding process. This recipe 
        guides you through creating a flavorful meat sauce, assembling the layers, and baking it to 
        golden perfection. It's a dish that tastes even better the next day!
    </p>
     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground beef (or a mix of beef and pork)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (28 oz) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 (6 oz) cans tomato paste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tbsp sugar (optional, to cut acidity)</li>
        <li>1.5 tsp dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp fennel seeds (optional, for flavor)</li>
        <li>1 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles (no-boil or regular, cooked al dente if regular)</li>
        <li>16 oz ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>Pinch of nutmeg (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 lb (about 4 cups) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>**Prepare the Meat Sauce:** In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add ground beef and cook until browned, breaking it up with a spoon. Drain any excess grease.</li>
        <li>Add chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in minced garlic and cook for 1 minute more until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, water, sugar (if using), basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 tsp salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low, cover, and let it cook for at least 30 minutes (longer is better for flavor development), stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>**Prepare the Ricotta Mixture:** In a medium bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, 1/2 tsp salt, nutmeg (if using), and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese. Mix well.</li>
        <li>**Preheat Oven & Prepare Noodles:** Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). If using regular lasagna noodles, cook them according to package directions until al dente. Drain and rinse with cold water to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>**Assemble Lasagna:** Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Place 3-4 lasagna noodles over the sauce (don't overlap too much).</li>
        <li>Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture evenly over the noodles.</li>
        <li>Top with about a third of the mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Spoon about 1.5 cups of meat sauce over the mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers: noodles, remaining ricotta, another third of mozzarella, and more meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Finish with a final layer of noodles, the remaining meat sauce, and the last third of mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>**Bake:** Cover the baking dish loosely with aluminum foil (you can spray the underside of the foil with cooking spray to prevent cheese from sticking).</li>
        <li>Bake for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and bubbly.</li>
        <li>**Rest:** Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving. This allows the layers to set and prevents it from falling apart.</li>
    </ol>
