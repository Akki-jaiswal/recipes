    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breast, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil or ghee</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1-inch piece ginger, grated</li>
        <li>1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes, undrained</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken broth or water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup heavy cream or coconut milk (optional, for richness)</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)</li>
        <li>**Spice Blend:**</li>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp curry powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp turmeric powder</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil or ghee in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add chicken pieces and cook until browned on all sides. Remove chicken from the pot and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add chopped onion to the pot and cook until softened and translucent, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in minced garlic and grated ginger. Cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the spice blend (curry powder, cumin, coriander, turmeric, cayenne, salt, and pepper) to the pot. Cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly, until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Pour in the diced tomatoes and chicken broth. Bring the mixture to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot.</li>
        <li>Return the browned chicken to the pot. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and tender.</li>
        <li>If desired, stir in heavy cream or coconut milk during the last 5 minutes of cooking for a richer curry.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh cilantro before serving. Serve hot with rice or naan.</li>
