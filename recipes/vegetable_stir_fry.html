    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil (or sesame oil for added flavor)</li>
        <li>1 head broccoli, cut into florets</li>
        <li>2 carrots, thinly sliced or julienned</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup snap peas or snow peas</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sliced mushrooms (e.g., shiitake or cremini)</li>
        <li>1/2 small onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1-inch piece ginger, grated</li>
        <li>**For the Stir Fry Sauce:**</li>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce (low sodium preferred)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp brown sugar or honey</li>
            <li>1 tsp cornstarch (mixed with 1 tbsp water to make a slurry)</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp sesame oil (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>**Prepare the Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, rice vinegar, brown sugar/honey, cornstarch slurry, and optional sesame oil. Set aside.</li>
        <li>**Heat Wok/Skillet:** Heat vegetable oil in a large wok or a large skillet over high heat until shimmering.</li>
        <li>**Cook Harder Vegetables:** Add broccoli florets and sliced carrots to the hot wok. Stir-fry for 3-4 minutes until slightly tender-crisp.</li>
        <li>**Add Softer Vegetables & Aromatics:** Add red bell pepper, snap peas, mushrooms, sliced onion, minced garlic, and grated ginger. Stir-fry for another 2-3 minutes until vegetables are bright and tender-crisp. Avoid overcooking.</li>
        <li>**Add Sauce:** Give the prepared sauce a quick whisk again (as cornstarch can settle) and pour it over the vegetables in the wok.</li>
        <li>**Thicken Sauce:** Cook, stirring constantly, for 1-2 minutes until the sauce thickens and coats the vegetables.</li>
        <li>**Serve:** Remove from heat immediately. Serve hot over steamed rice or noodles. Garnish with sesame seeds or chopped green onions if desired.</li>
    </ol>
