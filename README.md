### About This Mini Project

This project demonstrates foundational HTML skills, including:
- Basic page structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- Headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`)
- Paragraphs (`<p>`)
- Images (`<img>`)
- Unordered lists (`<ul>`) and ordered lists (`<ol>`) for ingredients and steps
- Hyperlinks (`<a>`) for navigation between pages

Future updates will include CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.
